# Kitsuyoru Website

## Welcome
- Kitsuyoru wishes you a warm welcome! Glad to see you on my new website.
- This site is still under construction, so stay tuned for more content and features.
- As far as for now - have a wonderful time, and thank you for stopping by!

## Background
- With this website, I wanted to experiment with the possibilities pure HTML and CSS have to offer.
- My main idea was to create HTML “submodules” and put them together like functions or methods in programming.
- The navigation bar and all posts like this one were written in separate HTML files and then merged into one main HTML file.
- This offers the advantage of not having to copy components repeatedly, such as the navigation bar.
- However, this concept lacks the control and interaction between these modules, e.g. the enlargement of embedded images on the entire website.

## Contents
- Besides testing the capabilities of HTML and CSS, I want to create some posts about my most played games - Minecraft and BeamNG.drive.
- I plan to upload new posts by programming a small local application that will automate the transfer of content directly to the repository.
- This way, GitHub remains the current host for the website and takes over the automatic deployment of newly published contributions.
- P.S.: This site runs entirely without JavaScript, advertising, cookies and other trackers. Feel free to take a look around and have fun!
