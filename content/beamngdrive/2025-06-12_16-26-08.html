                    Hello everyone! When I came up with the name Kitsuyoru (Night Fox) for my main games, I created a new paint job for my Hirochi SBR4 in BeamNG.drive. Originally, the vehicle was covered completely in dark blue metallic paint. For the new livery, I reduced the amount of metallic and changed the main color to a blue-violet mixture. Window decorations were also to be used for the new livery. The multi-layered skin system from BeamNG.drive allows suitable graphic reflections for stickers. I found a fox girl sticker to be thematically suitable for Kitsuyoru, which was applied to the hood, the rear side windows and the rear window. I decided to use white lettering as a contrast. In addition to the bows, enlarged fox ears were also placed above the rear wheel.
