                    Hi together! Today I discovered a fun mod in the BeamNG.drive repository. It can be found under the title Cat Ears by FalloutNode. As the name suggests, this mod allows supported vehicles from Hirochi, Ibishu, ETK and Cherrier to have cat ears mounted on the roof. These come in different colors such as black, red or orange. They can also be illuminated using the key combination for the light bar. For my Hirochi SBR4, I chose the black version with cyan-magenta lighting. The ears fill a similar volume to the fox ears on my new paint job. In supported police vehicles, the ears flash and can therefore replace the conventional light strips. All in all, a fun and high-quality modification for unique vehicles! Now I just have to find a suitable fluffy tail...
