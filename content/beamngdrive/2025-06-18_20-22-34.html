                    Hello! A few weeks ago, I tried to create my own world using the BeamNG documentation and the new world editor. My environment offers mainly natural height variations, obstacles and trails. The only materials used are grass, sand and stone, which form an island in the sea. There are mainly block-like jumps and a mountain with a spiral path to climb. At the top of the mountain is a lettering created with thin brushes of the materials, which marks the peak of the mountain. Also noteworthy are the numerous implied volcanic craters and peaks protruding from the ground. Slight vertical elevations on the mountains and hills add depth to the structures to emphasize the variation in materials. All in all, a small but exquisite island for an exciting off-road day!
