                    Hey! Today I would like to introduce you to an indoor swimming pool that I built a long time ago in Minecraft. The room consists mainly of wooden planks and logs, complemented by natural plants. In the middle is the large main pool, which is shallow at the sides and deep in the middle. There are functioning Redstone Lamps in the pool, which create a pleasant atmosphere. Additional Redstone Torches provide calming lighting. Above the pool are wave-like shapes made of wood that protrude slightly from the ceiling to create more depth. A small wooden bridge also crosses the pool and on one of the two shallow sides there is a waterfall that flows into the pool. Opposite is the entrance to a sauna room with a shower, which is also made of wood and surrounded by plants.
