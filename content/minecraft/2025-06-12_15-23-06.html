                    Hello everyone! I recently built this redstone elevator in Minecraft. It consists of an upper and a lower station, which can have any distance to each other. The actual elevator platform actually \u201cflies\u201d from one station to the other. It measures four by four blocks. This is made possible with the help of four independently operating piston engines, each driving a two-by-two platform, which are joined together to create the large platform size. I also had the idea of putting automatic piston doors at both stations, but also at the front and back of each station so that the elevator can be entered and exited in both directions. A Redstone block directly on the elevator operates these as soon as the elevator has entered. The buttons on the doors combine the function of calling the elevator, but also of starting the operation after a short delay.
