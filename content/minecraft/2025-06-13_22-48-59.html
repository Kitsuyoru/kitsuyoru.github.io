                    Hello! Today I finished the rough construction of my new Piglin Farm. The system receives Gold Ingots in a chest, which are loaded into a Hopper Minecart as required. As soon as it is sufficiently filled, it travels over all eight Piglin slots and loads them evenly with Gold Ingots. As soon as these are loaded, the bartering process can be started by pressing a button, which then runs automatically until the end. The items obtained can then be removed via an output box. Two Piglins have already arrived. Once the remaining six Piglins have arrived, the first test run can be started. A gold farm to procure the Gold Ingots is still under discussion.
