                    Hello everyone! Today I would like to introduce you to a wooden beach residence with a pool. In addition to the walkable gallery around the building, the flat sloping roof, which is divided into two parts that are offset in height, is particularly outstanding. A light sensor system is installed under the roof, which controls the entire exterior lighting of the property, including the pool, fully automatically. Inside the residence there is a control center for switching between manual and automatic lighting modes. The interior design is also striking, using dense tropical planting rather than solid walls to physically separate the rooms, as is the property boundary. The gallery is also accessible on both sides from the upper floor, so you can enjoy the view to the full.
