                    Besides testing the capabilities of HTML and CSS, I want to create some posts about my most played games - Minecraft and BeamNG.drive.<br>
                    I plan to upload new posts by programming a small local application that will automate the transfer of content directly to the repository.<br>
                    This way, GitHub remains the current host for the website and takes over the automatic deployment of newly published contributions.<br>
                    P.S.: This site runs entirely without JavaScript, advertising, cookies and other trackers. Feel free to take a look around and have fun!
