                    With this website, I wanted to experiment with the possibilities pure HTML and CSS have to offer.<br>
                    My main idea was to create HTML “submodules” and put them together like functions or methods in programming.<br>
                    The navigation bar and all posts like this one were written in separate HTML files and then merged into one main HTML file.<br>
                    This offers the advantage of not having to copy components repeatedly, such as the navigation bar.<br>
                    However, this concept lacks the control and interaction between these modules, e.g. the enlargement of embedded images on the entire website.
